# Practical Project - Mathematics III

### Introduction
This project was developed as part of the **Mathematics III** course. It involves the creation of neural networks to analyze and predict specific outcomes using two different datasets. The aim was to apply theoretical concepts in a practical setting, combining data preprocessing, neural network implementation, and performance evaluation.

### Project Overview

#### Water Potability Prediction
A neural network was built to predict the potability of water using a dataset provided in a CSV file titled ['Water Potability'](csvs/water_potability.csv). The model classifies whether a given sample of water is potable based on the features provided.

#### Credit Card Fraud Detection
Another neural network was developed to predict fraudulent transactions in a dataset titled ['Card Transactions'](csvs/card_transdata.csv). The goal was to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on their characteristics.

### Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
   - Missing values (NaN) and outliers were handled by replacing them with the median of the respective feature to ensure stability during training.

2. **Neural Network Implementation**  
   - Models were created using both manual implementations and Python libraries such as **Scikit-Learn** and **TensorFlow**. This dual approach was used to validate the results and compare performance.  
   - Separate models were designed for each dataset using both libraries.

3. **Documentation and Analysis**  
   - Detailed analyses of both datasets and their neural network models are provided in the **Research** folder. These documents include extended explanations of the studies conducted but exclude code.  
   - Jupyter notebooks include all functions, implementation details, and graphical visualizations.
